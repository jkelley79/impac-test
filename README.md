Summary
--------

This is my implementation for a technical exercise

Two subdirectories
------------------
### Ruby REST API ###
impac-api

### Angular web app ###
impac-ui

How to run it
-------------
cd impac-api
rails server

cd impac-ui
npm start

This will start the Ruby code on port 3000 and the Angular app on 8000 so the two
can talk.

Hopefully it all just works at that point and there is no technical glitch.

At this point launch:
http://localhost:8000/index.html

You should see two widgets one for Employee locations and the other for the Sales flow.
I went heads down on this one and didn't ask any questions so likely I made some bad
assumptions where normally I would have asked for clarification. Given my conversation
with Karine she relayed to be "creative" so hopefully that came through in my result.

Also the various easter eggs are meant to relay a sense of humor on my part and not a
lack of professionalism.
